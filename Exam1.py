#1 a: it does not work because it does not have a print statement
#b:it will work but it ill be stuck in an infinte loop. i would fix it by adding one each time after the print statment
#c it works
#d it will not work beacause of the indentation
#e it is never going to equal yo 5 so it can not break out of the loop and also it does not have a print satatment so it will not work
